:toc:

Welcome to microservices patterns workshop.
This workshop is intended to guide you through multiple microservice patterns, based on modularising a simplistic _TODO application(TM)_.

== Before we start

For sanity, when setting up a new task, start with `mvn install` with the parent `pom.xml`

To pre-download _half of internet_ of Maven dependencies, you can go to link:https://github.com/42patterns/training-deps[training dependencies repository] and follow the instructions. This will force download most (or all) dependencies used in the exercises.

== Splitting up monoliths

image::tasks-external_ui.png[]

There is a TODO application: two independent services talking over HTTP (REST): *todo-app* and *todo-app-ui*

=== Context

The *todo-app*(TM) is a simple TODO application built in a old-school way: EJB components with servlets and JSF sitting on a single application server (wildfly).
You can run the server with `mvn wildfly:run` and _play a bit with the app_ by browsing to http://localhost:8080/index.jsf

However, as the business evolves - the UI is planned to be replaced by a modern, JavaScript based frontend application. As a part of refactoring initiative a new front-end has be designed and implemented: `todo-ui`, which is a Single Page Application, with an idea to communicate with the old application through a set of REST-like HTTP calls.
The front end can be run independently by running `npm start` from *todo-app-ui* folder.

=== Task #{counter:exercise:0}

Make it run!

If you navigate to http://localhost:8080 you can see the new UI in place. It's deployed as independent a resource-jar file (Servlet 3.0) and it mock the real todo list behaviour. Whenever new item is added, it's not persisted and disappears upon refresh.

However, first step is done: legacy application is combined with the new UI.

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

Based on the defined interfaces, extend the existing application and provide a set of required API.

What additional changes needs to be done to allow application to application communication, when deployed separately? How can the application still be developed separately but deployed as a monolith?

IMPORTANT: Implement the missing methods in the `TodoResource` class for the test to successfully pass.

=== How to run

The Pact is prepared by the JavaScript application. It states the expectation; what resources are expected from the provider.

It's expressed as a Pact contract created in the test phase. The pact is than passed over to provider.

The pact file is located in `todo-app/src/test/resources`. An Arquillian test is built to validate the contract (`TodoResourceProviderIT`)

The test is run as a part of Intergration Testing phase which can be triggered with Maven's `mvn clean verify`. It spins wildfly instance on pre-integration phase and stops it during post-integration phase.

[TIP]
====
The missing UI artifact `com.example.patterns:todo-app-ui` can be buld with `mvn clean install` in the todo-app-ui folder. This builds the whole static html application outside the maven target folder (in `/tmp`) - not to download all node modules on every exercise.

The build can be also run manually:

* `npm install` - download dependencies
* `npm run build` - trigger `browserify` and copy static (html, css) files
* `mvn clean install -Plocal` - create static resources jar file
====

IMPORTANT: The automatic build can be problematic on Windows (as most nodejs builds) but manual path is validated and working at least on Windows7.

TIP
====
If you experience some nodejs issues while building the frontend application you can install it directly from file `mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.example.patterns -DartifactId=todo-app-ui -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=todo-app-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` when in folder `todo-app-ui`

Afterwards, you can build the whole project without `todo-app-ui` with maven `mvn clean install -pl !todo-app-ui`
====

== API Gateway

image::tasks-banner_service.png[]

The _TODO application(TM)_ become a great success, so that business wants to monetize the business by adding commercial banners on the top of the page.

=== Context

A new service has been added to the pool: a todo page displays a commercial banner provider directly from a service owned by the marketing department.
The functionality is provided by a *banners-service* service, which is a _full stack microservice_ - provides a random image, ready to include directly onto the todo page.

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

Introduce an API gateway - a new component which hosts the UI and routes appropriate requests to services:

- `/banners/&lowast;&lowast;` are forwarded to the *banners-service* (http://localhost:8081)
- `/api/&lowast;&lowast;` calls are forwarded to the legacy application - *todo-app* (http://localhost:8080)

IMPORTANT: Implement the missing TODOs in `GatewayApp.java` in the *api-gateway* project

=== How to run

To start the gateway run `mvn spring-boot:run` from *api-gateway* project. The gateway listens on the port 9999.

Banner service is a simple Spark Java micro framework. Run it from *banners-service* folder with `mvn package exec:java` command.

TIP: Remember that UI has changed (new banners) so UI needs to be rebuilt. If you have problems with building the UI directly with nodejs, install the jar file again (`mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.example.patterns -DartifactId=todo-app-ui -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=todo-app-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) from `todo-app-ui` folder.

== Circuit breaking

image::tasks-banner_service.png[]

The quality of the *banners-service* is below expectations and it fail frequently.

=== Context

The ads providing services goes offline on regular basis.
From _TODO application(TM)_ perspective this is not acceptable, as if results in a broken image icon on the front page.
To mitigate that, a `default-banner.png` has been provided to substitute the missing image.

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

In the *api-gateway* implementation provide a fallback for a missing image (either on exception of with a dedicated tool like Hystrix or Failsafe).

TIP: As the service provides an image directly, same "data structure" must be provided by the fallback mechanism (`byte[]`)

TIP: Failsafe documentation (https://github.com/jhalterman/failsafe) is a nice guide for different implemantation flavours.

IMPORTANT: Provide a default fallback option in the `GatewayApp#getBanners()` method.

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

While writing your own API Gateway might be a good idea, sometimes it becomes a bit cumbersome.
There are multiple out of the box libraries implementing this pattern (like Neflix Zuul).

Zuul provides configurable tooling for building a reverse proxy, especially with some Spring Cloud conventions.
Additionally, it comes with circuit breaking and load balancing mechanism provided by another Netflix libraries: Hystrix and Ribbon (we will look deeper into these later on).

IMPORTANT: Provide a default fallback mechanism (similar to the _in-house built_ *api-gateway* from the previous task. Please use `ZuulFallbackProvider` interface and provide it as a standard spring bean.

=== How to run

Run `mvn spring-boot:run` from *api-gateway-zuul* project. The gateway listens on the port 9999.

== Load balancing

image::tasks-profanity.png[]

No profane words should be allowed in the *todo-app*; everything matching profanity checks should be filtered-out.

=== Context

Additional service (*profnity-filter*) has been introduced in the application landscape.
It handles `POST` or `PUT` calls, checks profanity with an external *profanity-check-service*, amends the title (if required) and passes the request to the *legacy* _TODO Application_(TM).

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

For performance reasons more than one *banners-service* service can be started multiple times and the load should be evenly distributed between all services.
The *banners-service* service listens on port 8081 by default, but it can be configured with `-DPORT {port number}` parameter (to avoid ports collision).

Start multiple instances of banners service and distribute the workload evenly between all available instances of *banners-service*.

TIP: A quickstart reference manual from Spring is available here: https://spring.io/guides/gs/client-side-load-balancing/

IMPORTANT: In the *api-gateway* application, use the Spring based RibbonClient (from `spring-cloud-starter-ribbon`) to easily load balance between instances. The static list of servers can be added in the application configuration file.

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

As our in-house implemented *api-gateway* is getting a bit more complex, maybe it's a good moment to have a look deeper look into out of the box tooling.
In the *api-gateway-zuul* provide a static list of servers for each service (in the `application.properties` file - in a similar fashion it was done for *api-gateway*).
Additionally, add an appropriate filter configuration (implementing `ZuulFilter`), to check `POST` or `PUT` requests and forward them to *profanity-filter* instead of the original *legacy* _TODO Application_(TM).

IMPORTANT: Configure Netflix Zuul to evenly distribute load between all service instances.

== Service discovery

image::tasks-discovery.png[]

The number of hardcode service locations (hostnames and/or ports) is unacceptably low: it make the deployments static and fragile.
What is more, some ports are assigned randomly which makes the situation additionally complex.

=== Context

Eureka is a REST based service that is used for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.
When the number of services and instances increases greatly, it's impossible to manage embedded configuration.
Eureka inverses this process, allowing service registrations as well as pulling the latest service location directly from store.

In the our microservices environment the *profranity-filter* and *todo-app* are already auto registered.

The *profanity-filter* combines both automatic configuration (with `@EnableDiscoveryClient`) and manual configuration of services which are external (thus - don't register themselves).
The latter is done through explicit `@RibbonClient` annotation.

Finally, both *banners-service* and *todo-app* are not a spring applications, therefor require additional steps to register with Eureka.

The *todo-app* did it through explicit call to Eureka HTTP service (see the `DiscoveryClientConfig` bean).

The *banner-service* registration is done with the Eureka Client.

TIP: Original Eureka Client example might be helpful to proceed: https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/tree/master/eureka-examples

TIP: Besides Eureka Client dependency `com.netflix.eureka:eureka-client:1.6.2`, add `javax.inject:javax.inject:1` which is used for client's dependency injection engine.

TIP: link:https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Eureka-REST-operations[Eureka REST operations] and link:https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Understanding-eureka-client-server-communication[description of client-server communication] might be helpful for debugging and manual cancellation

NOTE: It takes time to propagate new instance within Eureka ecosystem; from instance registration to local load balancer (_ribbon_) cache. An detailed description (inluding configuration options) is available link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/373#issuecomment-110331739[on github].

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

To make the configuration consistent, introduce service discovery features in the rest of the services.
*api-gateway* (or *api-gateway-zuul*) can leverage Spring Cloud autoconfiguration.

TIP: The Spring's quickstart manual can give you heads up: https://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/

IMPORTANT: Auto register the *api-gateway* through `@EnableDiscoverClient` annotation.

=== How to run

Run the discovery service through `mvn spring-boot:run -f registry`.

TIP: Lookup registered application at http://localhost:8761/eureka/apps
