Welcome to microservices patterns workshop.
This workshop is intended to guide you through multiple microservice patterns, based on modularising a simplistic _TODO application(TM)_.

== Before we start

For sanity, when setting up a new task, start with `mvn install` with the parent `pom.xml`

To pre-download _half of internet_ of Maven dependencies, you can go to link:https://github.com/42patterns/training-deps[training dependencies repository] and follow the instructions. This will force download most (or all) dependencies used in the exercises.

== Splitting up monoliths

There is a TODO application: two independent services talking over HTTP (REST): *todo-app* and *todo-app-ui*

=== Context

The *todo-app*(TM) is a simple TODO application built in a old-school way: EJB components with servlets and JSF sitting on a single application server (wildfly).
You can run the server with `mvn wildfly:run` and _play a bit with the app_ by browsing to http://localhost:8080/index.jsf

However, as the business evolves - the UI is planned to be replaced by a modern, JavaScript based frontend application. As a part of refactoring initiative a new front-end has be designed and implemented: `todo-ui`, which is a Single Page Application, with an idea to communicate with the old application through a set of REST-like HTTP calls.
The front end can be run independently by running `npm start` from *todo-app-ui* folder.

=== Task #{counter:exercise:0}

Make it run!

If you navigate to http://localhost:8080 you can see the new UI in place. It's deployed as independent a resource-jar file (Servlet 3.0) and it mock the real todo list behaviour. Whenever new item is added, it's not persisted and disappears upon refresh.

However, first step is done: legacy application is combined with the new UI.

=== Task #{counter:exercise}

Based on the defined interfaces, extend the existing application and provide a set of required API.

What additional changes needs to be done to allow application to application communication, when deployed separately? How can the application still be developed separately but deployed as a monolith?

IMPORTANT: Implement the missing methods in the `TodoResource` class for the test to successfully pass.

=== How to run

The Pact is prepared by the JavaScript application. It states the expectation; what resources are expected from the provider.

It's expressed as a Pact contract created in the test phase. The pact is than passed over to provider.

The pact file is located in `todo-app/src/test/resources`. An Arquillian test is built to validate the contract (`TodoResourceProviderIT`)

The test is run as a part of Intergration Testing phase which can be triggered with Maven's `mvn clean verify`. It spins wildfly instance on pre-integration phase and stops it during post-integration phase.

[TIP]
====
The missing UI artifact `com.example.patterns:todo-app-ui` can be buld with `mvn clean install` in the todo-app-ui folder. This builds the whole static html application outside the maven target folder (in `/tmp`) - not to download all node modules on every exercise.

The build can be also run manually:

* `npm install` - download dependencies
* `npm run build` - trigger `browserify` and copy static (html, css) files
* `mvn clean install -Plocal` - create static resources jar file
====

IMPORTANT: The automatic build can be problematic on Windows (as most nodejs builds) but manual path is validated and working at least on Windows7.

TIP
====
If you experience some nodejs issues while building the frontend application you can install it directly from file `mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.example.patterns -DartifactId=todo-app-ui -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=todo-app-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` when in folder `todo-app-ui`

Afterwards, you can build the whole project without `todo-app-ui` with maven `mvn clean install -pl !todo-app-ui`
