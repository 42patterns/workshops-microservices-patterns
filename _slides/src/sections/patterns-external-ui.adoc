= Pattern #{counter:patterns}: Externalized UI

****
Leaving user interface for web developers
****

== Intent

In order to have a meaningful and valuable user experience, information must be

. *Useful*: Your content should be original and fulfill a need
. *Usable*: Site must be easy to use
. *Desirable*: Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation
. *Findable*: Content needs to be navigable and locatable on-site and off-site
. *Accessible*: Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities(+ Inclusive)
. *Credible*: Users must trust and believe what you tell them

== Problem

Refreshing frontend::
* Stack changes (migrating from JSP, JSF, Struts 1.x, GWT - you call it)
* Hard to find th right people.
** Full-stack that goes beyond backend and frontend in JavaScript
* Stack incompatibility
** Need to know Java to do JavaScript (GWT)
** Need to know Maven to build the application
** _Save - redeploy - refresh_ vs. _Save - refresh_

== Discussion

* Duality of the technology stack
** NodeJS + npm + bower + webpack ...
** Java + Maven / Gradle / ...
* Nobody wants JSF...

== !

Needs and tools mismatch::
* some features and impossible _(or unbelievably expensive)_
** 30 days for simple button change
** working against the framework, not together with it
* look-and-feel expectations
** free canvas vs. component based approach
** Material Design vs Adobe Flex UI Components

== !

Organizational shift::
* unable to find the right people for the job
** different aesthetics between backend engineers and frontend engineers
** the myth of full stack developer
* new roles (User Experience Designer)
** old communication problems (us vs. them)

== Structure - Build process

* Maven
** Orchestrate external build process through Maven
** Collect results into a single distribution
** JAR, Zip - you call it
* From server perspective the whole JavaScript is 'rather static'

== Structure - Deployment

* What was created in the previous step is actually a _WebJar_
** A client-side web library packaged into JAR (Java Archive) file
* _Servlet 3.0_ specification prescribes way to server static assets from Jar files
** the WebJars that are in the `WEB-INF/lib` directory are automatically made available as static resources
** this works because anything in a `META-INF/resources` directory in a JAR in `WEB-INF/lib` is automatically exposed as a static resource.
* The WebJar needs to be a dependency of the application

== Structure - Splitting the application

. Split EARs into multiple WARs
. One application per server
. Build, deploy and manage independently
