== Intent

Direct Client‑to‑Microservice communication rarely makes sense, due to:

* mismatch between the needs of the client and the fine‑grained APIs exposed by each of the microservices,
* some communication protocols might not be _web-friendly_ (binary RPC protocols used by some AMQP messaging protocols) - neither browser not firewall friendly,
* tight coupling might appear and it can make refactoring microservices difficult.

== Problem

== Discussion

API Gateway::
* a server that is the single entry point into the system
** similar to the Facade pattern from object‑oriented design
* encapsulates the internal system architecture and provides an API that is tailored to each client
* might have other responsibilities such as authentication, monitoring, load balancing, caching, request shaping and management, and static response handling

== !

Benefits::
* encapsulates the internal structure of the application
** provides each kind of client with a specific API
** reduces the number of round trips between the client and application
** simplifies the client code

Drawbacks::
* additional system (landscape) component (to be developed, deployed and managed)
* potential bottleneck
** API Gateway must be updated in order to expose each microservices endpoint

== Implementation

Various design issues for consideration::
* performance and scalability
* service invocation
* service discovery
* reactive programming model
* handling partial failures

== !

Performance and scalability::
* asynchronous and nonblocking I/O

== !

Service invocation::
* Different services might embrace different inter-process communication styles
** Message brokers (JMS / AMQP)
** Brockerless (Zeromq)
** Synchronous HTTP

Service discovery::
* API Gateway needs information about location (IP address) of each microservice it communicates with
** This information cannot be hardwire, due to dynamic nature of the microservice environment
** While infrastructure elements (message brokers) might have static location, application services might change from deployment to deployment

== !

Reactive programming model::
* Important when goes beyond simple routing requests to an appropriate backend service
* Dependency between requests
** validate the request by calling an authentication service
** routing the request to a backend service afterwards
* Managing multiple, dependent asynchronous calls

Handling partial failures::
* some downstream services might respond slowly or be unavailable
** API Gateway should never block indefinitely waiting for a response
** failure handling might depend on the specific scenario and which service is failing (default value, static / cached data, or returning error to a client)

== Examples

* Neflix Zuul
* Amazon API Gateway
* Homegrown implementation
