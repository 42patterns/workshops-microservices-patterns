= Pattern #{counter:patterns}: Service orchestration
:figure-caption!:

****
As we start to model more and more complex logic, we have to deal with the problem of managing business processes that stretch across the boundary of individual services
****

== Problem

Orchestration::
* Single point of failure
* Bottleneck

Choreography::
* Eventual consistency
* Nondeterministic behaviour

== Discussion

.Application flow

== Ochestration

* Relies on _central brain_ which guides and drives the process
** Flowchart can be taken directly to code
* Potential bottle neck or single point of failure
** Easy to reflect application flow / logic in code
** Easiest to implement and maintain (monitor)
** Hardest to scale
* Possible to leverage dedicated instrumentation and visualisation tools
** Rules engines / business process management
* Implied synchronous requets / response on every step of the process

== Choreography

* Each step is notified about expectations and let it figure out the details
** Event based communication
** Services emit asynchronous events
* Potential non-deterministic behaviour
** Eventually consistent application state
* Decoupling solution
** Naturally scalable
** If more subscribers are interested in particular event no additional work is required in the _Customer service_
* Additional effort on monitoring and tracking the right behaviour

== Implementation

* Asynchronous, nonblocking I/O
** Dedicated thread pool (dedicated `ExecutorService`)
* CompletableFuture
* RxJava
* JDeferred (_Deferred/Promise library similar_)
