= Microservices recap

== Why miroservices?

* Better scaling (of people not solutions)
* Decentralizing decisions
* Frequent deployments
* Reduced local complexity
** What about overall complexity? But...

== Problems we had

* Builds which takes forever
* Deployments which takes forever
* Implementation of a features which takes forever
* MTTRF (mean time to resolve failure) damaging organization reputation
* Atomic releases, you need to wait until all features are complete to release
* In case of failure you rollback all changes, even these ones which worked

== Problems we have

* No-one completely grasp the whole solutions. But is it a bad thing?
* Mind-shift requiring *new operating model*
* When things goes wrong it first the *where* problem rather than *why*?
* Potential increase in latency

== Conway's Law

[quote ,M. Conway]
""
Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.

== How are we solving it?

// TODO: rozwinąć te punkty np na bazie książki Bonera - Reactive_Microservices_Architecture

* Failure isolation - _bulkheading_
* Autonomous services - service promises its own behaviour by publishing
its protocol/API
* Single responsibility - encapsulate a single concept
* State ownership
* Asynchronous, message based communication
* Location transparency
